<p>Call us wrong on this one.The other week we suggested it didnt make much sense for Stratasys to purchase MakerBot, in spite of rumors.Regardless of our analysis, simultaneous press releases from both companies this afternoon say a deal has in fact been made. 
 The deal, set to close in Q3, is a stock swap where MakerBot will merge with a Stratasys subsidiary and operate separately, maintaining its own identity, products and go-to-market strategy. 
 Our previous analysis listed reasons why the deal didnt make sense.</p>
