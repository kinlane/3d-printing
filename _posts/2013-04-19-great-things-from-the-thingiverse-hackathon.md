<p>On April 6-7, MakerBot Headquarters played host to a few dozen members of the MakerBot and Thingiverse communities for the first ever Thingiverse Hackathon!If youâ€™ve never heard of a hackathon, check out this Wikipedia explanation.This was a fun couple of days with several great projects going on.Participants used the Thingiverse API to exploit Thingiverse data for other cool purposes, and we wanted to let you know the winners.There was a slight delay in sharing as the new Apps are still mostly in progress.</p>
