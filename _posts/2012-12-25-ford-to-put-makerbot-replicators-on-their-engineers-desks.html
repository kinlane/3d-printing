<p>Ford intends to equip many of their engineers with new Replicator 3D printers from MakerBot, according to GigaOM.The video shows one of Ford’s engineers explaining how he uses an older MakerBot in his work, so Ford has apparently been using these printers for awhile now.3D printers have been used by major companies for, quite literally, decades, but only recently have 3D printers become inexpensive enough for individuals to own.What is interesting here is that this shift towards low cost 3D printers is also changing the way that large companies use the technology.Instead of only having a few large, expensive 3D printers for an entire company, Ford has elected to provide their engineers with individual, less expensive printers.</p>
