<p>As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts.This is a first post in my ongoing evaluation of  the role of APIs in 3D printing and manufacturing.Im working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.Ive identified 10 major components of 3D printing:  Creators - 3D designers of virtual print objects
  	Scanners - Scanning hardware for generating 3D models
  	Modeling Software - Applications for building 3D models
  	File Formats - File formats for storing 3D models
  	Warehousing - Virtual storage for 3D models
  	Marketplaces - Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products
  	Printers - Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing
  	Process & Materials - The process and materials that go into 3D printing
  	Makers - The people who understand 3D printers, process, materials and industries
  	Delivery - Logistics behind getting 3D printed products to consumers
  
  Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.Ive been fortunate enough to talk with key people from Shapeways,  Makerbot, and Cloudfab, and get their opinion on the role of APIs in 3D printing and manufacturing.</p>
