<p>A new sturdy, fast and portable 3D printer is available on Kickstarter.The Bukito Portable 3D Printer by Deezmaker has already raised USD$100K to launch their new machine, so it seems that people are interested in 3D printing portability.  This is not the first 3D printer for Deezmaker; they previous released the Bukobot last year, raising over USD$167K.But why a second 3D printer?They say:  After our first successful Bukobot Kickstarter project, we started working on this design because we keep seeing the trend of others making low cost, but unreliable, 3D printers without really focusing on the details that make a 3D printer robust and basically do what they are suppose to: make great 3D prints.</p>
