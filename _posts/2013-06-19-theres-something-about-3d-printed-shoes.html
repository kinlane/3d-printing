<p>One of the most interesting items to 3D print on a high-power color 3D printer turns out to be shoes.We were blown away when we first encountered a color 3D printed shoe last year - the visual realism is only broken when you pick up the shoe and realize its made of sandstone.Â  Weve discovered a number of shoe print images on Zprints Flickr stream, some of which we show here.All of these are not real shoes.They are 3D prints, each made on a Zcorp color 3D printer.</p>
