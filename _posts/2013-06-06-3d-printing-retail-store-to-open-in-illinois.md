<p>Weve seen MakerBot pioneer 3D printing retail deep in New York City and then in London at the iMakr store.Now theres another retail venture taking place in Evanston, Illinois - which is just north of Chicago, for those unfamiliar with the area.  GetPrinting3D is a showroom where visitors can take a look at 3D printing technology first hand, ask questions and examine 3D printed objects.The shop is set to open in late June.  The Dayton, Ohio-based company has evidently been selling 3D print technology for some time, but now has chosen to open a retail operation in Evanston.</p>
