{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im working on a new trends section of API Evangelist.&nbsp;One area im tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs.&nbsp;
I did some fun research, and laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011.&nbsp;This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo.&nbsp;
As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts.</p>
