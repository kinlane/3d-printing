{% include JB/setup %}<p>I did some fun research, and laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011. This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo. 
 As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts.With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact. 
 Ive identified 10 major components of 3D printing:
 Creators - 3D designers of virtual print objects
 Scanners - Scanning hardware for generating 3D models
 Modeling Software - Applications for building 3D models
 File Formats - File formats for storing 3D models
 
 This series was just to help me understand the major components, and I will do another series on how APIs can impact these areas.</p>
