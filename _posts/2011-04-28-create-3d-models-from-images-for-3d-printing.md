<p>3D printing innovators Shapeways has released a new concept in 3D Printing.Image Popper is a new tool that allows you to upload a black and white JPG, and Shapeways will generate 3D model from it.After the image is uploaded you can choose the size and how much you want the drawing raised to create the 3D object.Innovative tools like Image Popper that allow users to build 3D models for 3D printing without CAD experience is an important piece of moving forward the 3D printing and manufacturing industry.</p>
