<p>We’ve just released a new and improved version of our 3D print lab.Let’s take a look at some of the new things we introduced.We haven’t changed the main idea of how the 3D print lab works.With no login required, you still upload a 3D file of your design for which you’ll see an instant price.Then you choose a material, a color/finish, rescale the model if necessary and order as many copies as you want.</p>
