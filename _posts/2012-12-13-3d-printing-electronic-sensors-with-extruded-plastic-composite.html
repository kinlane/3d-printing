<p>3D printed electronics has been the subject of experiments and speculation for awhile now, but it usually involves highly specialized 3D printers.Carbomorph, a new, experimental plastic and carbon composite, could allow touch sensors, like buttons, to be integrated into objects 3D printed with fairly basic plastic extrusion printers.Carbomorph was invented by researchers at the University of Warwick in the UK.They discovered that Carbon Black filler combined with polycaprolactone (PCL) would change its conductivity when flexed, suggesting 3D printed sensors.</p>
