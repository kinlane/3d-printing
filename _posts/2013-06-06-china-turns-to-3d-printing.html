<p>Apparently some 40% of 3D printer installations are in the United States, while other countries lag significantly behind.China is positioned at only 9% despite being the worlds leader in manufacturing.  That may change as a new conference specifically focused on 3D printing took place in Beijing.The World 3D Printing Conference, which concluded last week, was evidently the first of its kind in China.  Many of the six hundred attendees were likely unfamiliar with 3D printing and this could have been their first up close encounter with the technology.</p>
