<p>Last month, we introduced ShapeJS, and were excited by all the things developers are creating with it.In the spirit of the season, we wanted to share our new favorite ShapeJS app:  The Ornament Creator.Its an easy and fun tool for you to play with for the holidays: just sketch a squiggle, upload the image, and well wrap it around a sphere to create a unique ornament for your tree!Just be sure to order by December 16th to ensure delivery for Christmas.Try it out and please leave us your feedback here, since ShapeJS is still in beta and were seeking to improve it.</p>
