<p>When youre interested in investing in 3D printing, there doesnt seem to be a lot of options at first glance.The publicly traded 3D printer manufacturers are few: Stratasys, 3D Systems and most recently, ExOne.Â 
 Is that all the choice you have?No!Theres more ways to catch the 3D printing boom.</p>
