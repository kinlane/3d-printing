<p>You may have seen their periodic and increasingly frequent solicitations for new employees.These have indeed added up and we now find that MakerBots staff exceeds 200 persons.This is vastly larger than almost all of the other personal 3D printer companies with the exception of the big commercial companies. 
 Along with their staff theyve also been increasing their space, currently some 40,000sf and perhaps doubling by the end of the year to a massive 80,000sf. 
 Their NYC retail store still stands - but we speculated earlier that they just might open a London retail store.</p>
