<p>A fascinating art installation leveraging 3D printing is proposed by artist Bill Westheimer of New Jersey.His work Ascent explores the idea of transforming analog man into digital man.  He started with a 3D scan of a hand and then performed successive transformations on it to produce hands that evolve into a digital form.This builds on his recent book, Manual - The Personalities of Hands, which profiles hands, famous and not.  Why Kickstarter?</p>
