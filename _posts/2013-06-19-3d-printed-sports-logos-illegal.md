<p>Boston, Massachusetts is the original home of ZCorp, now owned by 3D Systems.Its also the home of the Boston Bruins NHL hockey club, currently battling the Chicago Blackhawks for the championship Stanley Cup.Â  In 2011 the Bruins won the cup and the folks (or perhaps fans) at ZCorp printed out the Bruins official logo above.Since that time weve seen multiple sports logos developed specifically for 3D printing.Normally these logos are 2D items, so it takes some creativity to convert them into 3D structures.</p>
