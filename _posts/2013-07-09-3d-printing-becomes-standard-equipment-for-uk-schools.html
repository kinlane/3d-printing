<p>UK Education Secretary Michael Gove announced Englands schools will use a new national curriculum commencing in September 2014.While the new curriculum contains a variety of improvements, there is a rather interesting inclusion: exposure and basic training on the use of advanced technologies such as robotics and 3D printing.  This implies each UK school (at least the public ones) will effectively be required to provide a 3D printer, associated software and training to children as young as five years old.  First, someone is going to sell an awful lot of inexpensive 3D printers.There are approximately 17,000 primary schools in England alone, and if each required at least one 3D printer, well, you get the picture.</p>
