<p>I was already a big fan of the T-800, T-850 and the liquid metal shape-shifting T-1000.But last week, I bumped into the T8.This one is not a Terminator, but a bio-inspired high resolution 3D printed spider that uses a total of 26 servo motors, and it’s powered by the Bigfoot™ Inverse Kinematics Engine.Believe me, it has written ‘WANT’ all over it.The T8 by Robugtix™ is an octopod that can mimic the movements of a real spider.</p>
