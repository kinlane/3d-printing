<p>Harry Slotwiner is a 16 year old high school student at Pelham Memorial High School in New York.He was also one of the youngest and brightest participants at our first annual MakerBot Hackathon.Accessing the Thingiverse API, Harry created I Made One, a cool and useful iOS application which allows users to upload photos of 3D objects to Thingiverse directly from their phone.Making, remixing and customizing designs is at the heart of the Thingiverse community.Publishing an “I Made One” with a picture of a successful print gives props to the original designer and also empowers users to experiment.</p>
