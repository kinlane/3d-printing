<p>Thingiverse users ctheroux and whpthomas have been great advocates for using Helper Disks, which act like feet on the corners of your model to help keep everything pinned down.When the MakerBot Slicing Engine sees the disks, it treats them as part of the model.Once the print is finished, the disks can be peeled or cut away pretty easily.Below is a quick step-by-step for using these little lifesavers.Try Helper Disks out and share your experience with us in the comments below or on twitter: @makerbot.</p>
