<p>Engineers in the UK are using 3D printing with a nylon powder to create a really cool, futuristic bicycle.Guided by a computer-aided design program, a laser fuses together several layers of finely powdered metal, nylon or plastic.The laser melts the powder, which solidifies according to a chosen pattern.Then more powder is added, melting and solidifying to add layer upon layer until the object is fully formed.Its just a prototype of whats possible with current 3D printing and manufacturing technology.</p>
