<p>Walking around the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore Todd, simply chose an item, walked around it whilst muttering to himself/Glass and walked away with enough images to convert into a 3D model using 123D Catch.I just walked around the work, repeating, ok glass, take a picture over and over, 30 shots in total. No real care in aiming the shot. I just looked at it and thats it. Then I manually uploaded the photos from Google Autobackup to 123D Catch on my computer and proceeded as normal.</p>
