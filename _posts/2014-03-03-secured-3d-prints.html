<p>Before we get into the service provided by Secured3D, you might want to know why one would even need secure 3D printing.The cause is actually file formats.Your 3D model files are converted into GCODE by a 3D printer’s slicing software.The GCODE actually instructs the printer to make the object.  So if you had possession of the GCODE file you could 3D print as many copies as you like.</p>
