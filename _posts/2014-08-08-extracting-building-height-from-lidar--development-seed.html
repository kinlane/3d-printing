<p>Lidar is similar to radar.but with lasers.Lidar produces incredibly accurate and specific spatial information, making it great for measuring building heights and modeling the impact of floods and raising sea levels.Advances in lidar technology are making lidar data more available.Humanitarian drones may make it possible to collect up-to-date lidar data in the midst of a humanitarian crisis.</p>
