<p>Smithsonian X 3DÂ to be held in Washington November 13-14 is a free event which will show how 3D technologies will transform the work of the Smithsonian Institution, and museum and research institutions worldwide.For the first time ever, state-of-the-art 3D scanning and image-based modeling technology paired with new Smithsonian tools will enable museum collections, scientific specimens, and entire research sites to be digitally recorded, studied, and shared in immersive detail.Researchers and conservators can use 3D capture to document and analyze a single artifact or an entire field site.Curators and educators can use 3D imagery to explore complex ideas and share new discoveries.Teachers, collaborators, and members of the public can interact with Smithsonian museum objects in new ways.</p>
