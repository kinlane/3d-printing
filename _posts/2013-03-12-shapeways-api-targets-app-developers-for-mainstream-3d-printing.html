<p>Shapeways, 3D printing company, officially released the Shapeways API to inspire new apps specifically aimed at the 3D printing space.Shapeways hopes that the API (and accompanying developer portal) will help bring 3D printing into everyday use.Although 3D printing has developed into a profitable business for many 3D printer owners, it has yet to become mainstream.Shapeways representative, Elisa Richardson, commented on the app-based approach:





More than 8,000 Shapeways’ shop owners made over half a million in profits last year, and Shapeways’ expects the first Shapeways millionaire to arise soon.However, while in beta, the API proved a tremendous opportunity beyond brick and mortar, and Shapeways expects quick adoption.</p>
