<p>Why clean when you can illuminate?New York based industrial designer Christian Stolarz has designed two elegantly simple components for 3D printing that transform an every day broom stick into a beautiful lamp. I was unhappy with the lighting situation in my house, thank god Im a designer and able to fix this situation!Just as Sprout, designed by Egant converted a plastic milk jug into an easy to use watering can, the Broom Stick Floor Lamp combines a few items you may already have lying around your home to transform them to more than the sum of its parts.The 3D printed parts fit standard broomsticks with a 23.</p>
