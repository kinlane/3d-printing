<p>In 2007 the popular statue Rodins Thinker was stolen from the Singer Laren museum and damaged while the thieves were trying to destroy and sell it for scrap metal.At the request of the museum, a team of 3D printers at Materialise, took 3D scans of the damaged statue to assist in repairs.Using of of their Materialize 3D printing machines, the largest 3D printer in the world, they created a mold that was used to restore the statue.An interesting example of how 3D printing is not just for creating new works, it can repair historic artifacts as well.</p>
