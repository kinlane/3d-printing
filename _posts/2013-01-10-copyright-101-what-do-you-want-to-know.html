<p>As the field of 3D printing grows, were starting to see more and more cases of copyright infringement, creative sharing, collaboration, and general discussion happening around what is allowed, what is possible, and what is protected.To address this, we want to put together a 3D Printing Copyrights 101 guide in the next few weeks, with the help of Michael Weinberg who wrote the awesome whitepaper It will be awesome if they dont screw it up.Weve done a few blog posts covering the debate over the last two years, and now we want to consolidate new information and answer your questions.</p>
