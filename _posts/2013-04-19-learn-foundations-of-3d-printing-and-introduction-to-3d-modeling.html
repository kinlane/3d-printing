<p>This class has evolved greatly over the past year and a half.This is an extended version that is essentially two classes: Foundations of 3D Printing, and Introduction to 3D Modeling.The goal of the class is to give a complete primer on printing processes and software, then show how you can apply that knowledge to create your own designs and manufacture them at home or from a service bureau like Shapeways.You will also learn about selling items from your Shapeways shop, custom object co-creation, and the logistics of re-selling printed items through other venues like Etsy and Ebay.Â </p>
