<p>If there was any doubt 3D printing was going to be taken seriously by the business world, then note this news: Minnesota-based Stratasys just had a big-city shopping spree and picked up MakerBot, a cool Brooklyn-based 3D printing company you may have heard of, for $403 million.It wasnt exactly a buy that was far afield for Stratasys, itself a professional-grade 3D printer operation.But the merger, set around $403 million in stock and potentially another $201 million in performance-based payouts, has sent some shockwaves around the maker community.Reactions range from concerns that the larger company may absorb MakerBot, or at least the special sense of community the small four-year-old company engenders, to excitement that the startups efforts are getting the recognition it deserves.(See also What Is A MakerBot, And Why Does It Matter?</p>
