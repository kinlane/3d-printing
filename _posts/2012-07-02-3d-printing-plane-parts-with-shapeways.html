<p>Check out this video by BSAV showing the excitement of receiving his first 3D Printing from Shapeways. Ben has 3D Printed his part in White Strong Flexible (Nylon) bit it would also be awesome to see this 3D Printed in polished Alumide for a little more stiffness and less drag with the smoothness.</p>
