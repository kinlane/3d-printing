<p>On the heels of its debut in May 2013, the MX3D-resin printer has already evolved from a machine only capable of building in plastic to one that can print in a variety of metals.Designed by Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) students Petr Novikov and Saša Jokić, the MX3D is a robotic arm actuated 3D printer capable of printing on any surface.Originally designed to produce parts using a fast curing resin, the original MX3D-Resin could print objects with any sweep and curve without the need of additional support structures.Building on their original design, Petr and Saša have teamed up with the Netherlands’ Joris Laarman Studio to advance their design and create a 3D printer that can build objects using metals that range from steel to copper.Read more at ENGINEERING.</p>
