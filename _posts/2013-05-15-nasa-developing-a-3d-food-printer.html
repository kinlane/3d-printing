<p>According to a report in New Scientist, NASA is funding research that could lead to 3D printed food technology.Texas-based Anjan Contractor of Systems and Materials Research Corporation obtained funding from NASAs Small Business Innovation Research Program to develop a fully functional 3D food printer.Â  The goal of this program is to creat te a way to produce nutritious food, while storing the ingredients compactly, during a lengthy Mars mission.We suspect another major benefit sought is to introduce variety and change into food preparations.If youre stuck in a tiny spacecraft for over a year, youd like some variety, too.</p>
