<p>Were reading a very short post on Zheng 3 where they attempted to print a Magic: The Gathering Beast Token.As you can see above, there were some very slight problems in successfully completing this operation. 
 And thats the problem - 3D printers are simply not sufficiently reliable.Weve used many different 3D printers from many manufacturers and while they all have very different characteristics, one thing most 3D printers have in common are print failures. 
 It might happen immediately, partially, or tragically just as the print nears completion.</p>
