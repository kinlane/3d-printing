<p>At first it seemed to be sideline experiments, but now we are seeing a pattern.Tall 3D printers are here to stay. 
In the beginning the build volume of most personal 3D printers was more or less a cube with almost equal sides.Like you’d see in a kitchen oven.However, over time experimenters worked out ways to create 3D printers that had a much larger z-axis, enabling the printing of tall objects.</p>
