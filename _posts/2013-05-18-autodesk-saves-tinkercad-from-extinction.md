<p>Autodesk has announced that it has purchased Tinkercad and its core technology to resurrect the browser based 3D modeling app from the dead.Several weeks ago Tinkercad killed the popular 3D modeling app, closing new users and announcing a slow death for existing users from the free to the pro accounts. Todays news that Autodesk is saving Tinkercad is even sweeter as it has unlocked all of the pro features so you now have unlimited designs as well as access to the superscripts that take the relatively simple drag and drop assembly of geometry to a greater level of 3d modeling complexity.The Autodesk team are also planning to continue to develop the 3D modeling app further with more import and export options and it may even find its way into the already impressive 123D range of apps that are perfect to design for 3D printing with Shapeways.</p>
