<p>Sourcing high resolution models for design work (and 3D printing) can be difficult and expensive.There are a fair number of free community 3D models on the web, but many are low quality or have restrictions against commercial use.That’s where Forme It, a new service that sells high resolution 3D models, comes in.Forme It’s library of 3D models is broken down into three main areas: Reference, Classic, and Modern.Reference contains models of the natural world, sorted into animal, plant, and mineral.</p>
