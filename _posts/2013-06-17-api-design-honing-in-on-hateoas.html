<p>We recently discussed the six constraints of REST but today well deepen our discussion of hypermedia as the engine of application state or HATEOAS (hay-dee-ous), in an attempt to understand what HATEOAS really means.State Diagram Here is a state diagram, which is essentially a directed graph with a series of nodes and arcs.Nodes represent states in the state machine, and arcs represent transitions.When traversing the state machine, you move through states via transitions.This has significance toward understanding REST, as exemplified in the following quote about experiencing REST in the real world: “ The name ‘Representational State Transfer’ is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: a network of Web pages (a virtual state-machine), where the user progresses through the application by selecting links (state transitions), resulting in the next page (representing the next state of the application) being transferred to the user and rendered for their use.</p>
