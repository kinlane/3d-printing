<p>Once in production, a 3D model will be printed layer by layer using one of four potential 3D printing processes and corresponding materials: Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) - SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.Stereolithography (SLA) - Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer resin and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time.On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) - FDM works on an additive principle by laying down material in layers.A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.</p>
