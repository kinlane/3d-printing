<h1>About Backend as a Service</h1>
<p>This is a project site to track on the Backend as a Service (Baas) also known as Mobile Backend as a Service (BBaas) space.</p>
<p>I host individual research projects and sections of API Evangelist as their own Github repositories.  This way projects can evolve on their, independint of the overall site.</p>
<p>BaaS represents an important trend in the evolution of APIs in an effort to support mobile development.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this research, contact me at <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a>.</p>
